# Spaceship-Titanic

Welcome to the year 2912, where a cosmic mystery awaits your data science skills. The Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner, met an unfortunate fate when it collided with a hidden spacetime anomaly during its maiden voyage to three newly habitable exoplanets. Nearly half of the 13,000 passengers onboard were transported to an alternate dimension, leaving a challenging rescue mission.

In this Kaggle challenge(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview), I present an SVM (Support Vector Machine) model designed to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly, based on records recovered from the spaceship's damaged computer system. SVM is a powerful algorithm for classification tasks, well-suited for separating data points in high-dimensional space using hyperplanes.

By leveraging SVM's ability to discern patterns and make accurate predictions, this model aims to assist the rescue crews in identifying the affected passengers, enabling their safe retrieval from the alternate dimension. Through meticulous feature engineering and model optimization, I have created a robust solution to this cosmic mystery.

Key Features:

1. Utilized SVM algorithm for classification

2. Employed advanced feature engineering techniques to extract meaningful insights from the damaged computer system records

3. Optimized the SVM model for performance and accuracy
