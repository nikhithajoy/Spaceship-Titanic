# Spaceship-Titanic

Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are needed to solve a cosmic mystery! In this Kaggle challenge, you have been enlisted to assist in rescuing passengers who were transported to an alternate dimension following a collision between the Spaceship Titanic and a spacetime anomaly near Alpha Centauri.

The Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner carrying nearly 13,000 individuals, was on its inaugural voyage to three newly habitable exoplanets. However, tragedy struck when the ship collided with a hidden anomaly within a dust cloud, reminiscent of the ill-fated oceanic vessel of the past. While the ship remained intact, almost half of the passengers vanished into an alternate dimension.

The mission is to utilize the recovered records from the spaceship's damaged computer system to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly. By analyzing the available data and employing the data science expertise, we can assist the rescue crews in locating and retrieving the lost passengers.
